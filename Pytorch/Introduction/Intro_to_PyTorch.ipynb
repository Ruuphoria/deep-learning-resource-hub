    "# Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) is a very powerful machine learning framework. Central to PyTorch are [tensors](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html), a generalization of matrices to higher ranks. One intuitive example of a tensor is an image with three color channels: A 3-channel (red, green, blue) image which is 64 pixels wide and 64 pixels tall is a $3\\times64\\times64$ tensor. You can access the PyTorch framework by writing `import torch` near the top of your code, along with all of your other import statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will help introduce you to the functionality of PyTorch, but don't worry too much about memorizing it: the assignments will link to relevant documentation where necessary."

    "# Why PyTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "One important question worth asking is, why is PyTorch being used for this course? There is a great breakdown by [the Gradient](https://thegradient.pub/state-of-ml-frameworks-2019-pytorch-dominates-research-tensorflow-dominates-industry/) looking at the state of machine learning frameworks today. In part, as highlighted by the article, PyTorch is generally more pythonic than alternative frameworks, easier to debug, and is the most-used language in machine learning research by a large and growing margin. While PyTorch's primary alternative, Tensorflow, has attempted to integrate many of PyTorch's features, Tensorflow's implementations come with some inherent limitations highlighted in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notably, while PyTorch's industry usage has grown, Tensorflow is still (for now) a slight favorite in industry. In practice, the features that make PyTorch attractive for research also make it attractive for education, and the general trend of machine learning research and practice to PyTorch makes it the more proactive choice.

    "\n",
    "One important property is the device of the tensor - throughout this notebook you'll be sticking to tensors which are on the CPU. However, throughout the course you'll also be using tensors on GPU (that is, a graphics card which will be provided for you to use for the course). To view the device of the tensor, all you need to write is `example_tensor.device`. To move a tensor to a new device, you can write `new_tensor = example_tensor.to(device)` where device will be either `cpu` or `cuda`."
